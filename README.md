# 📐 Java Pattern Printing Program

This is a beginner-level Java console application developed as part of my learning journey in **BCA 2nd Semester** at **Dezyne E’cole College, Ajmer**. The project focuses on printing various **patterns** using loops—an essential concept for mastering the Java programming language.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This program includes several simple but visually structured **pattern outputs**, built using nested loops and control flow. Examples include:

* ★ Star Patterns
* 🔢 Number Patterns
* 🧱 Pyramid & Triangle Structures

These are great for practicing logic building and understanding how loops work in Java.
